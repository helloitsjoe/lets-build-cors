# Let's Build CORS!

This repo is an example of a server showing what CORS is, how it works, and how
to work with it. It can be incredibly frustrating to deal with CORS until you
have a good mental model for it. The error messages can make it unclear what
actions you can take to get things working. I hope this repo helps you
understand things better, and if you have any suggesetions feel free to file an
issue!
